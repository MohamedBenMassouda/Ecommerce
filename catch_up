What I have done so far:
    - Made a core app to hold the base templates and the utilities
    - Made a users app to hold the user profile and the user registration and auth
    - Made a products app to hold the product model and the related stuff
    - Made a cart app to hold the cart model and the related stuff

Each app does target a specific functionality and is not supposed to be used for anything else.
The core app is the only one that is not specific to the project and can be used for other projects.
